#from active collection loop all objects: 3 type objects: with faces (tris only), with only egdes, with only verts
#create TIN surface from face objects 
#create breakLines from edges - you need 1 object for every continuus line - named by object name - order is solved by algorymt (Blender can have edges in any order)
#create CgPoints from vert type object - you need only one such object, name by vert index

#control checks and UI will maybe added in future, unexpected results and behavior will most probably occur if you dont follow the rules
